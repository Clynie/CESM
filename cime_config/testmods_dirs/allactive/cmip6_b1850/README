Note that this includes cmip6_picontrol_outputhighfreq rather than just
cmip6_picontrol_outputbase or cmip6_picontrol_outputdeck: We assume that
cmip6_picontrol_outputhighfreq does everything that those others do plus
some additional stuff for high-frequency output. So, if
cmip6_picontrol_outputhighfreq works, then we can be fairly confident
that the others work, too.
