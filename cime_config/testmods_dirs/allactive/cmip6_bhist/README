Note that this includes cmip6_histcontrol_outputhighfreq rather than
just cmip6_histcontrol_outputbase or cmip6_histcontrol_outputdeck: We
assume that cmip6_histcontrol_outputhighfreq does everything that the
others do plus some additional stuff for high-frequency output. So, if
cmip6_histcontrol_outputhighfreq works, then we can be fairly confident
that the others work, too.
