This usermods directory contains configuration settings that are a good
starting point for most CMIP6 runs. However, they'll probably need to be
modified for any particular experiment.

Note that these settings have some, but not all of the output settings
used in a typical CMIP6 experiment. Thus, this usermods directory is a
good starting point if you want reduced output volume.
